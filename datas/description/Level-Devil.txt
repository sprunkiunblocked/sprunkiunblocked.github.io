        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Level Devil is a platformer with a mean twist. Your goal is simple: get to the door at the end of the level to win. But beware! Holes can appear out of nowhere, spikes can move unexpectedly, and ceilings can fall as you navigate through the various levels. One wrong step and it's game over!</p>
        <p>Keep your wits about you, expect the unexpected, and most importantly: don't get angry!</p>
