<h2>Monkey Mart Overview</h2>

<h3>Game Concept</h3>
<p>Monkey Mart is an idle/management game where you control a cute monkey character in charge of a supermarket. Plant fruits, harvest produce, and move around to fill the stands with various food items like bananas, corn, eggs, peanuts, coffee beans, chocolate, and wheat. Customers will pick up items and wait at the cashier desk for you to collect your money. As you unlock new aisles and grow your market, you can hire assistants and buy appliances to prepare advanced products like chocolate bars, coffee, yogurt, popcorn, and ice cream. Upgrade your characterâ€™s managing skills and wear cool hats while managing your market!</p>

<h3>How to Play Monkey Mart</h3>
<p>Run around the market to grab fresh crops and stand next to the aisles to stack them up for customers. Your character will automatically do the work as long as you're in the right place!</p>
