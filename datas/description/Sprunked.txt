Welcome to Sprunked
Sprunked is a fan-made mod of the popular music-mixing game Incredibox, offering a fresh take with custom sounds, visuals, and themes. This mod takes the original concept and expands it, giving players new creative possibilities for music creation.

What is Sprunked?
Sprunked enhances the Incredibox experience by introducing custom sound elements, new visuals, and alternate themes. While the original game lets players combine beatbox, vocal, and instrumental loops to create music, Sprunked deviates from this formula by adding unique combinations and visual styles that offer a fresh and exciting take on the gameplay.

This fan-made mod is perfect for players who enjoy the music-mixing concept but want something new and different, offering endless creativity and fun as you craft your own tracks.

How to Play Sprunked
Drag and Drop Sounds: Begin with a selection of icons representing different sound elements, including beats, melodies, and effects.
Create Combinations: Drag and drop these sound icons onto character avatars to trigger the sounds. Your goal is to combine these elements into a cohesive and creative music track.
Unlock Bonuses: Achieve special sound combinations to unlock bonus animations or songs that enhance both the music and visuals.
Share Your Mix: Once you've crafted the perfect track, you can share it with others or save it to enjoy later.
